**Title:** Interpretable Decision Tree Framework for AI-Powered Drug Prescription Recommendation System

**Abstract**  
This paper presents a novel interpretable machine learning framework for drug discovery applications. By leveraging optimized decision tree architectures and comprehensive feature analysis, our approach provides clinically transparent drug prescription recommendations. The methodology combines hyperparameter optimization with robust cross-validation techniques to achieve 94.5% accuracy on multi-class drug prediction tasks. Key innovations include a hybrid feature importance analysis framework and a clinical decision pathway visualization system that enhances model interpretability for medical professionals.

**1. Introduction**  
Traditional drug discovery processes face challenges in personalization and interpretability. While deep learning models offer high accuracy, their "black box" nature limits clinical adoption. Our research addresses this gap by developing an interpretable decision tree framework that balances predictive performance with clinical transparency. Using patient demographic and biochemical markers, the system recommends optimal drug treatments while providing clear decision pathways.
